# Building AI Agents with Pydantic AI

Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework for building production-grade Generative AI applications.
This skill provides patterns, architecture guidance, and tested code examples for building applications with Pydantic AI.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User asks to build an AI agent, create an LLM-powered app, or mentions Pydantic AI
- User wants to add tools, capabilities (thinking, web search), or structured output to an agent
- User asks to define agents from YAML/JSON specs or use template strings
- User wants to stream agent events, delegate between agents, or test agent behavior
- Code imports `pydantic_ai` or references Pydantic AI classes (`Agent`, `RunContext`, `Tool`)
- User asks about hooks, lifecycle interception, or agent observability with Logfire
- The agent design includes optional instructions, specialist workflows, long-tail tools, or any context the model does not need on most turns

Do **not** use this skill for:
- The Pydantic validation library alone (`pydantic`/`BaseModel` without agents)
- Other AI frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen)
- General Python development unrelated to AI agents

## Quick-Start Patterns

### Create a Basic Agent

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    instructions='Be concise, reply with one sentence.',
)

result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')
print(result.output)
"""
The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.
"""
```

### Add Tools to an Agent

```python
import random

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'google:gemini-3-flash-preview',
    deps_type=str,
    instructions=(
        "You're a dice game, you should roll the die and see if the number "
        "you get back matches the user's guess. If so, tell them they're a winner. "
        "Use the player's name in the response."
    ),
)


@agent.tool_plain
def roll_dice() -> str:
    """Roll a six-sided die and return the result."""
    return str(random.randint(1, 6))


@agent.tool
def get_player_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    """Get the player's name."""
    return ctx.deps


dice_result = agent.run_sync('My guess is 4', deps='Anne')
print(dice_result.output)
#> Congratulations Anne, you guessed correctly! You're a winner!
```

### Structured Output with Pydantic Models

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent


class CityLocation(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str


agent = Agent('google:gemini-3-flash-preview', output_type=CityLocation)
result = agent.run_sync('Where were the olympics held in 2012?')
print(result.output)
#> city='London' country='United Kingdom'
print(result.usage)
#> RunUsage(input_tokens=57, output_tokens=8, requests=1)
```

### Dependency Injection

```python
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    deps_type=str,
    instructions="Use the customer's name while replying to them.",
)


@agent.instructions
def add_the_users_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


@agent.instructions
def add_the_date() -> str:
    return f'The date is {date.today()}.'


result = agent.run_sync('What is the date?', deps='Frank')
print(result.output)
#> Hello Frank, the date today is 2032-01-02.
```

### Testing with TestModel

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel

my_agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', instructions='...')


async def test_my_agent():
    """Unit test for my_agent, to be run by pytest."""
    m = TestModel()
    with my_agent.override(model=m):
        result = await my_agent.run('Testing my agent...')
        assert result.output == 'success (no tool calls)'
    assert m.last_model_request_parameters.function_tools == []
```

### Use Capabilities

Capabilities are reusable, composable units of agent behavior — bundling tools, hooks, instructions, and model settings.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import Thinking, WebSearch

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-4-6',
    instructions='You are a research assistant. Be thorough and cite sources.',
    capabilities=[
        Thinking(effort='high'),
        WebSearch(),
    ],
)
```

### Add Lifecycle Hooks

Use `Hooks` to intercept model requests, tool calls, and runs with decorators — no subclassing needed.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.capabilities.hooks import Hooks
from pydantic_ai.models import ModelRequestContext

hooks = Hooks()


@hooks.on.before_model_request
async def log_request(ctx: RunContext[None], request_context: ModelRequestContext) -> ModelRequestContext:
    print(f'Sending {len(request_context.messages)} messages')
    return request_context


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[hooks])
```

### Define Agent from YAML Spec

Use `Agent.from_file` to load agents from YAML or JSON — no Python agent construction code needed.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

# agent.yaml:
# model: anthropic:claude-opus-4-6
# instructions: You are a helpful research assistant.
# capabilities:
#   - WebSearch
#   - Thinking:
#       effort: high

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml')
```

## Task Routing Table

Load only the most relevant reference first. Read additional references only if the task spans multiple areas.

| I want to... | Reference |
|---|---|
| Create/configure agents, choose output types, use deps, define specs, or pick run methods | [Agents Core](./references/AGENTS-CORE.md) |
| Bundle reusable behavior or intercept lifecycle events | [Capabilities and Hooks](./references/CAPABILITIES-AND-HOOKS.md) |
| Decide what should load eagerly vs on demand, apply progressive disclosure, defer capability loading, or explain `load_capability` | [Capabilities on Demand](./references/ON-DEMAND-CAPABILITIES.md) |
| Add function tools, toolsets, MCP servers, or explicit search tools | [Tools Core](./references/TOOLS-CORE.md) |
| Use provider-native web search, web fetch, or code execution | [Native Tools](./references/NATIVE-TOOLS.md) |
| Use advanced tool features such as approval, retries, `ToolReturn`, validators, timeouts, or tool search | [Tools Advanced](./references/TOOLS-ADVANCED.md) |
| Work with multimodal input, message history, or context trimming | [Input and History](./references/INPUT-AND-HISTORY.md) |
| Test or debug agent behavior | [Testing and Debugging](./references/TESTING-AND-DEBUGGING.md) |
| Coordinate multiple agents or build graph workflows | [Orchestration and Integrations](./references/ORCHESTRATION-AND-INTEGRATIONS.md#coordinate-multiple-agents) |
| Call the model directly, expose A2A, use durable execution, embeddings, evals, or third-party integrations | [Orchestration and Integrations](./references/ORCHESTRATION-AND-INTEGRATIONS.md) |
| Compare abstractions, output modes, decorators, or model-string patterns | [Architecture and Decision Guide](./references/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Follow an older link into `COMMON-TASKS.md` | [Task Reference Map](./references/COMMON-TASKS.md) |

## Architecture and Decisions

Load [Architecture and Decision Guide](./references/ARCHITECTURE.md) only when the user is choosing between abstractions or wants comparison tables and decision trees:

| Topic | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Decision Trees | Tool registration, output modes, multi-agent patterns, capabilities, testing approaches, extensibility |
| Comparison Tables | Output modes, model provider prefixes, tool decorators, built-in capabilities, agent methods |
| Architecture Overview | Execution flow, generic types, construction patterns, lifecycle hooks, model string format |

**Quick reference — model string format:** `"provider:model-name"` (e.g., `"openai:gpt-5.2"`, `"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6"`, `"google:gemini-3-pro-preview"`)

**Quick reference — key agent methods:** `run()`, `run_sync()`, `run_stream()`, `run_stream_sync()`, `run_stream_events()`, `iter()`

## Key Practices

- **Python 3.10+** compatibility required
- **Progressive disclosure by default**: For every capability, explicitly consider whether `defer_loading=True` would benefit the agent before choosing eager loading. Do not eagerly load specialist instructions, rarely used tool schemas, or domain context unless the model needs them on most turns. Prefer capabilities on demand for named instruction+tool bundles, and tool search for large flat tool catalogs.
- **Observability**: Pydantic AI has first-class integration with Logfire for tracing agent runs, tool calls, and model requests. Add it with `logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()`. For deeper HTTP-level visibility, `logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=True)` captures the exact payloads sent to model providers.
- **Testing**: Use `TestModel` for deterministic tests, `FunctionModel` for custom logic

## Common Gotchas

These are mistakes agents commonly make with Pydantic AI. Getting these wrong produces silent failures or confusing errors.

- **`@agent.tool` requires `RunContext` as first param**; `@agent.tool_plain` must **not** have it. Mixing these up causes runtime errors. Use `tool_plain` when you don't need deps, usage, or messages.
- **Model strings need the provider prefix**: `'openai:gpt-5.2'` not `'gpt-5.2'`. Without the prefix, Pydantic AI can't resolve the provider.
- **`TestModel` requires `agent.override()`**: Don't set `agent.model` directly. Always use the context manager: `with agent.override(model=TestModel()):`.
- **`str` in output_type allows plain text to end the run**: If your union includes `str` (or no `output_type` is set), the model can return plain text instead of structured output. Omit `str` from the union to force tool-based output.
- **Hook decorator names on `.on` don't repeat `on_`**: Use `hooks.on.run_error` and `hooks.on.model_request_error` — not `hooks.on.on_run_error`.
- **`history_processors` is deprecated; use `capabilities=[ProcessHistory(p), ...]`**, or hook `before_model_request` directly via `capabilities=[Hooks(before_model_request=fn)]`. `ProcessHistory` is a thin wrapper around that hook — the hook itself is the underlying primitive. The kwarg still works in 1.x but emits a `PydanticAIDeprecationWarning` and will be removed in v2.

## Task-Family References

Load exactly one of these unless the task clearly spans multiple families:

| Task family | Reference |
|---|---|
| Core agent setup, output, deps, specs, models, run methods | [Agents Core](./references/AGENTS-CORE.md) |
| Capabilities, hooks, and reusable behavior | [Capabilities and Hooks](./references/CAPABILITIES-AND-HOOKS.md) |
| Progressive disclosure, deferred capabilities, capabilities on demand, and `load_capability` semantics | [Capabilities on Demand](./references/ON-DEMAND-CAPABILITIES.md) |
| Function tools, toolsets, MCP, explicit search tools | [Tools Core](./references/TOOLS-CORE.md) |
| Provider-native tools | [Native Tools](./references/NATIVE-TOOLS.md) |
| Approval, retries, validators, timeouts, rich tool returns, tool search, and tool-level deferred loading | [Tools Advanced](./references/TOOLS-ADVANCED.md) |
| Multimodal input, message history, history processors | [Input and History](./references/INPUT-AND-HISTORY.md) |
| Testing, request inspection, and Logfire debugging | [Testing and Debugging](./references/TESTING-AND-DEBUGGING.md) |
| Multi-agent patterns, graphs, direct API, A2A, durable execution, embeddings, evals, third-party integrations | [Orchestration and Integrations](./references/ORCHESTRATION-AND-INTEGRATIONS.md) |

Use [Task Reference Map](./references/COMMON-TASKS.md) only for compatibility with older links or when you need a pointer from an old section name to the new file.
