# Task Reference Map

This file exists as a compatibility index for older links into `COMMON-TASKS.md`.

Prefer the narrower task-family guides below so the agent loads only the material it needs:

- [AGENTS-CORE.md](./AGENTS-CORE.md) — agent creation, output, deps, specs, models, run methods
- [CAPABILITIES-AND-HOOKS.md](./CAPABILITIES-AND-HOOKS.md) — `Thinking`, `WebSearch`, `Hooks`, custom capabilities
- [ON-DEMAND-CAPABILITIES.md](./ON-DEMAND-CAPABILITIES.md) — progressive disclosure, deferred capabilities, capabilities on demand, `load_capability`
- [TOOLS-CORE.md](./TOOLS-CORE.md) — `@agent.tool`, `Tool`, toolsets, MCP, common search tools
- [NATIVE-TOOLS.md](./NATIVE-TOOLS.md) — provider-native tools like `WebSearchTool` and `CodeExecutionTool`
- [TOOLS-ADVANCED.md](./TOOLS-ADVANCED.md) — approval, retries, `ToolReturn`, timeouts, validators, tool-level deferred loading
- [INPUT-AND-HISTORY.md](./INPUT-AND-HISTORY.md) — multimodal input, message history, history processors
- [TESTING-AND-DEBUGGING.md](./TESTING-AND-DEBUGGING.md) — `TestModel`, `FunctionModel`, `capture_run_messages`, Logfire
- [ORCHESTRATION-AND-INTEGRATIONS.md](./ORCHESTRATION-AND-INTEGRATIONS.md) — multi-agent patterns, graphs, A2A, direct API, durable execution, embeddings, evals, third-party tools

## Working with the Installed Pydantic AI Package

Prefer the checked-out repository or these bundled references first.

Inspect local package source only as a last resort when:

- the user asks about a symbol that is not covered in this skill
- the local environment already includes `pydantic_ai` and you need exact module layout
- you have no narrower offline reference available
